      Kira Box is a collection of my web tools, all developed out of personal
      interest. This project is built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It was renamed
      and fully refactored from MBRjun-Toolbox in May 2025.

      This project is partially open-source. More source code will be released
      on GitHub in the future, and links will be provided below.

      I began learning frontend development for the first time alongside this
      project.
